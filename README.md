# Python-Compiler


## GOAL

This program is meant to take as input a *high level* python program and produce as output
*low level* x86 assembly which can then be assembled, linked, and loaded into memory to emit
a functional program.


### SPECIFIC GOALS

1. Write a Python program that initializes two variables. Assign these variables integer values and add them together,
and assign the result to another variable. Call the print function on this last variable to print the result.
    - Variable assignment.
    - Integer addition.
    - Function calling.


## DESIGN

- Written in C for portability and speed (also because I wanted to learn C).
- Scanner generated by flex. In future may write from scratch or use something more relevant/modern.
- Parser generated by Bison. Will definitely write from scratch in future after MVP reached.


## TO DO

### Add scanning for:

- Function and variable identifiers.
- Whitespace.
- Floats, integers, other bases such as binary.
- Strings.

### Generate:
- parser
